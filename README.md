3D reconstruction with an event camera
The aim of the work is to create a system enabling the reconstruction of 3D information on the basis of data recorded with an event camera or cameras. The used methods will be based on classic vision systems algorithms adapted to data from event cameras, or on deep/ impulse neural networks.
